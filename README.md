# Description
For this project, I wanted to test backend to frontend work, so I decided to have my Backend WebAPI call the Github API to get a list of all my repositories and the info associated with my repos. Then have my frontend call the backend, and use that data to dynamically create my react components to display my repos name, description, and a link to view the repository.

## Results
Here is the Swagger Web API with my GetAll Method that calls the Github and my models to used to hold the information that is obtained from the API call
